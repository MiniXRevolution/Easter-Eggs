# 🕵️ Mini X-Revolution Easter Egg

Welcome to a hidden interactive experience within the **Mini X-Revolution** ecosystem. This project is a digital secret, designed for those who explore the code and look beyond the visible interface.

## 🌟 About the Project
This is a standalone "Easter Egg" page that combines mystery with retro gaming. It uses a minimalist, dark-themed terminal aesthetic and remains completely inert until the user performs a specific hidden action.

## 🕹️ Features
* **Ghost Input Field:** An invisible text input that captures keystrokes without being seen on the UI.
* **Simulated Terminal:** A scripted animation that mimics a secure server connection and authentication process.
* **Built-in Snake Game:** A fully functional, self-contained "Snake" game (Classic Mode).
* **Cross-Platform:** Optimized for both Desktop (Keyboard) and Mobile (Swipe/Touch gestures) with a responsive Canvas engine.

## 🤫 How to Unlock
The page appears as a simple message, but the true content is locked.
1.  Open the page in any modern web browser.
2.  Type the secret keyword: `minix` (lowercase).
3.  The terminal will automatically initialize, granting access to the game selection.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
* **Frontend:** Pure HTML5 and CSS3 (Inter Font, Glassmorphism, and Keyframe animations).
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (No external libraries required).
* **Gaming Engine:** Uses the **HTML5 Canvas API** for high-performance frame rendering and collision logic.
* **Control System:** Dual-input system using `keydown` events for PC and `touchstart`/`touchmove` for mobile navigation.
